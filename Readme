Screenshot Capture & Stop Scripts
This repository contains two scripts designed to work together to capture screenshots on a Windows machine and provide a way to stop the capture process gracefully.

1. screenshot.ps1
This PowerShell script continuously takes screenshots of the primary monitor every second and saves them as PNG files in a folder:

Creates a folder at C:\Nopt\screenshots if it doesnâ€™t exist.

Takes a screenshot every second and saves it with a timestamped filename.

Automatically stops after running for 1 hour.

Also stops early if a file named stop.txt is detected inside the screenshots folder.

This script is intended to run silently in the background and can be launched via the companion VBScript.

2. start.vbs
This VBScript is a simple launcher that runs the screenshot.ps1 PowerShell script silently and hidden:

Executes the PowerShell script with execution policy bypass and hidden window.

Designed to start the screenshot capture without showing a console window.

3. stop.vbs (Optional)
An additional VBScript that can be run to stop the screenshot capture process:

Locates the C:\Nopt\screenshots folder.

Creates a file named stop.txt inside the screenshots folder.

When stop.txt is present, the PowerShell script detects it and stops taking screenshots.

Usage
Use start.vbs to begin capturing screenshots.

Use stop.vbs to gracefully stop the capture process before the 1-hour timeout.
