Based on the DuckyScript conversion, this script would perform the following actions on a Windows computer when a USB Rubber Ducky (or similar HID device loaded with this script) is plugged in:

Initial Delay: It would wait for 2 seconds (DELAY 2000). This is a common practice to give the computer time to recognize the USB device and for the operating system to fully load and stabilize after the device connection.

Open Run Dialog: It would simulate pressing the Windows Key + R (GUI r). This opens the "Run" dialog box in Windows.

Type "powershell" and Open PowerShell:

It would then type the word "powershell" (STRING powershell) into the Run dialog.

After a short delay (DELAY 500), it would press Enter (ENTER), which executes the typed command and opens a PowerShell console window.

Wait for PowerShell to Load: It would wait for 5 seconds (DELAY 5000). This is crucial because PowerShell can take a few moments to fully initialize and be ready to accept commands, especially on slower machines.

Inject and Execute the Keylogger Script:

This is the most critical step: It would then type a very long string (STRING $code = {...}) directly into the open PowerShell window. This string contains the entire PowerShell keylogger function as defined in the original C++ code.

This PowerShell script does the following:

Defines a function My-Keypresses: This function is the actual keylogger.

Imports Windows API functions: It dynamically loads functions from user32.dll (like GetAsyncKeyState, ToUnicode) that allow it to monitor and capture keyboard input at a low level, regardless of which application is in focus.

Creates a log file: It creates or overwrites a file named mykeypress.txt in the user's %TEMP% directory (e.g., C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Temp\mykeypress.txt).

Starts a background job: It executes the My-Keypresses function as a background PowerShell job using Start-Job. This means the keylogger will run in the background without a visible PowerShell window or process directly blocking the console, making it less obvious to the user.

Runs for a limited time: The keylogger is configured to run for 10 seconds ($timeoutSeconds = 10). After this duration, the background job will be removed.

Captures keystrokes: While running, it constantly polls for key presses. When a key is detected, it converts the raw key code into its corresponding character (handling Shift, Caps Lock, etc.) and appends it to the mykeypress.txt file.

Final Execution:

After typing the entire keylogger script string, it waits briefly (DELAY 500).

Finally, it presses Enter (ENTER) again to execute the typed string in PowerShell, thereby launching the keylogger as a background job.

In essence, this DuckyScript would automatically and quickly deploy a keystroke logger onto a Windows machine. For 10 seconds, it would capture every key pressed by the user and save those keystrokes to a hidden temporary file.
